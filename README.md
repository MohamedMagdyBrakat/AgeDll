**AgeDll**
this is a C# DLL (dynamic link library ) built on .Net Framework Core version 8 , 
which can be used to calculate age according birthdate and target date , 
it can also create a string representation for the entire age as years , months , days 

for example 
you can send birth date and target date you need to calcualte age between them 
then it will return 3 int values for years , months , days .

you can also create a string representation for years , months , days 
as Age : 3 years . 5 months . 15 days 

note it will return string with contains items which has values greater than 0 
I wish it can help anyone intersted ðŸŒŸ
